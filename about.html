                Felicia Billie Paulson, also known as FakeBand Presents, is a 27-year-old
                singer-songwriter who enjoys stealing candy from siblings, writing music and camping.
                Born in Ottawa, Canada, she currently states that she's a citizen of the whole world.
                <br /><br />
                She started studying business studies at college but never finished the course, pursuing
                musical career instead. In 2012 she was discovered by Fake Records and was offered a deal.
                8 months later she went on her first ever tour, promoting her first CD 
                <b style="color:rebeccapurple"> Abstraction Won't Take Me Alive"</b>. The album has since
                sold million of copies.<br /><br />
                After a succesful beginning, encouraged, she proceeded to write and record music. That is how
                her two other albums came to be. Despite being controversial, 
                <b style="color:rebeccapurple">"All I have is my Bombshell" (2014)</b> sold even more copies than
                her debut album.
                <b style="color:rebeccapurple">"until debt tear us apart" (2016)</b> is by far her most 
                personal album. She sings her heart out about the ecological tragedy her generation was 
                born into.
